# Polynomial Equalizer

A VST3 Plugin created for the course *NPRG045: Individual Software Project* at Charles University

The goal of this project is to create a working VST3 plugin that can be used in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) with some non-trivial functionality.

This plugin will later be forked and used to create a more advanced VST plugin that experiments with various audio processing technology.
