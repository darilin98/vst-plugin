# VST3 Plugin

VST Plugin created for the course NPRG045: Individual Software Project at Charles University

The goal of this project is to create a working VST3 plugin that can be used in any DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) with some non-trivial functionality.

This plugin "skeleton" will later be used to create a more advanced VST plugin that experiments with various audio processing technology.
