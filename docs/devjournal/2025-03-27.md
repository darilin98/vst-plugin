# Journal Entry 1

This past week I've been installing the vst3sdk.

It took me quite a while and the process was very frustrating at times. Just getting the cmake to work and properly link the libraries took a while.

The basic vst plugin architecture is based on a processor (audio workload) and controller (user interface) dynamic.

The validator app included in the sdk helped me gradually debug my plugin. Only it made me realize that I was missing a bundleEntry function

I was stuck for a long time on a problem with this bundleEntry function just because I misunderstood it and gave it the wrong signature. This lead me to spiral into searching for a problem in places where it was not present.

### Estimated time spent

- Creating CMake - 3 hours

- Creating a skeleton plugin - 5 hours
