# Journal Entry 2

After consulting our current progress, we've decided that the next step is to try and create something with fftw3.

In its current state the plugin builds successfully and Waveform recognizes it. When enabled it sets all incoming audio data to 0.

I've already linked the fftw library in the cmake, so now the plan is to create a very basic equalizer.

- Deconstruct the incoming sound using fftw3

- Alter predetermined frequencies by some fixed parameters

- Reconstruct the result

On a different note (pun intended), I've finished reading chapter 2 of Fundamentals of Music Processing. The book is very helpful so far as I truly want to understand what my goal is with the fft operations.

I plan on skimming through the chapter a few more times and maybe even check out more chapters.

### Estimated time spent

- Reading chapter 2 of FMP - 3 hours
