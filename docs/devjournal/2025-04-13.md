# Journal Entry 3

This past week I've been playing with the FFTW library

I managed to create a very simple "equalizer"

There were some minor issues with the variation of the FFTW library

I learned that the library has both float precision and double precision variations of all methods

For now, I've settled on the float variation which meant a bit more tinkering with CMake to enable it

- Float precision is supposed to be a better fit for real-time audio processing

I also tried if the controller part of the program works. For some reason it always generates 2 extra knobs for dry level. But I tried to add a new gain knob and that showed up so I'm definitely in control of my controller (heh).

When I successfully tested the plugin in the DAW, I created a new class for the Fourier transform to already start to separate code concern as the process method was growing at a rapid pace.

### Estimated time spent

- Implementing basic Fourier transform - 3.5 hours
