# Journal Entry 3

This past week I've been playing with the FFTW library

I managed to create a very simple "equalizer"

There were some minor issues with the variation of the FFTW library

I learned that the library has both float precision and double precision variations of all methods

For now, I've settled on the float variation which meant a bit more tinkering with CMake to enable it

- Float precision is supposed to be a better fit for real-time audio processing

I also tried if the controller part of the program works. For some reason it always generates 2 extra knobs for dry level. But I tried to add a new gain knob and that showed up so I'm definitely in control of my controller (heh).

When I successfully tested the plugin in the DAW, I created a new class for the Fourier transform to already start to separate code concern as the process method was growing at a rapid pace.

Attempting to expand the transform onto all channels introduced some memory problems that caused crashing during runtime

This was quite tricky to debug as the validator was not flagging any issues and I had to try every change in the DAW

But I managed to implement a vector of unique pointers to Fourier processors for each channel

I also partially fixed some artifacting issues that were caused by buffer size inconsistencies

### Estimated time spent

- Implementing basic Fourier transform - 3.5 hours

- Expanding to multichannel transform - 2 hours
