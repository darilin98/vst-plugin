# Journal Entry 4

Since the last journal entry I've been working hard on reducing the distortion created by the plugin effect.

I'm happy to say that the windowing is working - I added a Hann window to the FFT and the signal is clear now. However, it was not at all that painless:

- Just multiplying the input by a window made it way worse - but I understand why
  - I was basically just dimming the end of each block and stacking them after each other which of course creates noise
- Thus I needed to figure out a way to overlap these window blocks
  - When Hann windows are overlapped half-and-half they perfectly match up
    - See Fig. 8.7 in FMP
  - An extra buffer needed to be created which is sized to 1.5x of FFT size and holds two windows with the middle part overlapping
- Finally another buffer needed to be created to output only the amount of samples the host requests

Once this was done I found another issue. The Waveform bypass button.

Turning the hosts bypass on/off creates small bursts of crackle.

However, (after a lot of debug logging) I found out that:

- You can implement your own bypass to introduce graceful start/exit
- BUT: Waveform refuses to adhere to it - its logic is just to stop calling the main process method
  - This means that I am unable to prepare for a sudden change in states
- I created my own bypass where I later on plan to do fade-in/out and hosts like Cubase should support it

### Estimated time spent

- Windowing implementation - 3.5 hours

- Bypass button struggles - 4 hours
