# Journal Entry 5

I've been organizing the project in preparation for the EQ curve experimenting

Mainly: 

- Adding working parameters and connecting them across classes

- Integrating the equalizer class

I settled on a design where the processor creates an equalizer and then gives it as a reference to all fft processors.

This way the processor calls parameter updates on the equalizer during the main loop and the processors request modulation at their liking.

I also accidentaly created a huge issue when I blindly made the reference a weak_ptr and that caused my computer to almost explode, thankfully I figured it out and now I'm only using shared pointers.  

Next I can finally focus on trying to equalize with a fun curve that can use live updating parameters.


### Estimated time spent

- Integrating Equalizer and parameters into the project - 4 hours
