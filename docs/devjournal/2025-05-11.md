# Journal Entry 6

I managed to actually implement some fun functionality to the plugin.

For now the polynomialEQ class is modulating the sound by a quadratic function.

I added the following parameters which are connected and working through the controller:

- Shift, decides on which frequency the apex of the parabola lies
- Width, how many frequencies are effected around the centre frequency
- Direction - whether we're decreasing or increasing gain around the area
- Intensity - how tall the actual parabola is, how much we're going to be changing gain

With these parameters the plugin can actually produce many interesting effects during audio processing.

The EQ is implemented in a way that the user picks the center frequency around which gain gets changed but when the parabola hits the x axis it flats out to 0.
    This approach seemed the best to me because just slapping a parabola on the frequency axis as is would result in us dimming all other frequencies which is not ideal.

I also visualized the EQ function in Desmos which helped me understand what's going on.

### Estimated time spent

- Iterating on different function EQ ideas - 3 hours
- Getting the current version working in the DAW - 2 hours
