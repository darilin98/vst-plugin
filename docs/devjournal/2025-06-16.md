# Journal Entry 7

I had a small break from this project due to exam season

However, during this time I still managed to put some work in.

The main topic of this phase was (and still is) VSTGUI

Last month I spent hours just getting the thing to build properly. And even then it introduced many other problems I needed to troubleshoot.

So I spent a lot of time not even writing code but trying to get stuff to compile properly.

I created a very simplistic GUI for the plugin just to check that all knobs work and are connected.

This also means that the bypass can finally be an on/off switch.

### Estimated time spent

- Getting VSTGUI to build with my project - 4 hours
- Figuring out how to use the tool - 3 hours
- Fixing integration of custom GUI to DAW - 3 hours
- Creating prototype GUI design - 2 hours
