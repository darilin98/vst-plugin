# Journal Entry 8

I spent a week on making the EQ curve come to life.

First, I worked out how to create a container for a custom view and register it.

When I had a working view container I tested the SDK's draw feature. It works well for drawing functions. 

The domain of the function needed to be adjusted - so the y axis indicates dB boost and the x axis is frequency from 20Hz to 20kHz.

Connecting parameters to the custom view was probably the most tricky part, I had to make a listener class and really crawl through forums to find out what's the proper way to do it.

Overall this milestone had some hiccups but I managed to push through and create a working function visualizer that is updated by parameters.

### Estimated Time Spent

- Registering custom view - 3 hours
- Static curve drawing - 5 hours
- Connecting controller parameters to curve view - 5 hours
