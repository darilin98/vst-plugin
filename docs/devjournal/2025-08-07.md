# Journal Entry 9

After getting sidetracked by another audio-related project I needed to finished I managed to work on the preset switching feature.

However, it turned out to be a really painful process. I thought I could just use the COptionMenu view that is a part of the SDK but it kept on giving unpredictable behavior.

It took a lot of logging and searching and still don't fully know whether it was caused by a bug or by something I induced.

My solution was to then build my own view which encapsulates the option menu and inject it my own custom listener to control the logic on my own. Only then I managed to finally get it to switch and stay in place properly.

I also played around with desmos to create some function shapes but I'm not sure whether they're final. They don't really translate well to the logarithmic scale.

Finally I added frequency and decibel markers to the graph view just to give more clarity and I think it turned out nice.

### Estimated Time Spent

- Option menu troubles - 10 hours
- Graph view work - 4 hours
