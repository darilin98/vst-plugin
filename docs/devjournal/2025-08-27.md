# Journal Entry 10

I spent some time creating an issue on GitHub for the GUI bug I wrote about in the previous journal entry.

So far, the administrator requested me to provide a mock example of the issue which I did. I'm now waiting for a response to see if there will be some further steps to make.

Next on the list of tasks was building on Windows.

As expected this took a lot of time, and it was a very infuriating process. 

A list of the issues encountered:

- VST sdk only works with the MSVC toolchain - not the cross-platform mingw
- FFTW on Windows cannot be built like on UNIX
- Due to FFTW on Win being pre-built it comes as a dynamic library and thus needs to be in the right locations
- Fixing the CMake for Windows also managed to break it for macOS

Future development

- Add custom testing
- Final polish to codebase
- Package the plugin (should be simple now that I have the binaries)
- Documentation

### Estimated Time Spent

- Creating VSTGUI GitHub issue - 4 hours
- Refactoring CMake for Windows - 12 hours
